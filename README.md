# O-GLOVE-demo

Connect the uno board to the computer and run the code of the arduino part, transmit it to the processing through the serial port communication, and run the code of the processing part.

arduino:
Before uploading the burning code, first download the uploaded compressed files Adafruit_Sensor-1.1.9, BMX160-master, CH341SER, add them to the library of arduino and use them, and connect O-GLOVE to the computer through the data transmission line to provide power and signals; Then copy the code of arduino_demo to arduino and upload it. After seeing the upload is complete, keep the window;

processing:
First download the sound file in the uploaded data file package, open processing, and add the downloaded sound file to the file. Use the sound library and serial library to input sound and serial port information; copy the code of the uploaded file processing_demo into the current window, and click to run;

Wear gloves for the test;
